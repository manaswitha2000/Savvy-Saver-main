**Introduction**
<p>In today's digital era, online shopping has become increasingly popular, with numerous e-commerce platforms offering a vast range of products. However, with the multitude of options available, it can be challenging for consumers to find the best prices and deals. To address this issue, we have developed a website that allows users to compare prices of different products across various e-commerce websites such as Amazon, Myntra, Ajio, and Flipkart. By aggregating product information and displaying prices from multiple platforms, our website provides users with a comprehensive and convenient way to make informed purchasing decisions. In addition to price comparison, the website offers features such as personalised accounts, advanced search filters, notifications for price drops and restocks, and review analysis, enhancing the overall user experience. With the potential to expand to other sectors such as transportation applications, our website aims to simplify and optimize the online shopping experience for users.</p>

• Scope - The scope of the project initially includes a limited number of
products from various categories due to database limitations. However, future enhancements could involve expanding the product range and enabling users to select specific websites to display prices from. Furthermore, the project has the potential to extend its functionality to compare prices across different transportation applications such as Uber, Ola, and Rapido.

• Stack - The website is developed using a full stack framework Django, providing a robust and scalable architecture. The database management system used is dbsqlite, which effectively handles the storage and retrieval of product information. DevOps tools such as Git, GitHub, and Jenkins are utilised to ensure efficient version control and continuous integration throughout the development process.

**Required Tools** -
• Jenkins for CI/CD pipeline execution.
• Docker for image creation and pushing into docker hub. • GitHub/Git for source control management.
• Django for web development.
• dbsquite for database.
• Ansible for configuration management and deployment. • Docker-compose for deployment.
• ELK for continuous monitoring
